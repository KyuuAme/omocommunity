# Shizuku Discord Bot Terms of Service

---

## 1. Introduction

Before inviting Shizuku to your Discord server, please read these Terms of Service ("ToS") thoroughly. By utilizing Shizuku, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree with the terms laid out in this document, do not proceed with inviting Shizuku to your server.

---

## 2. Eligibility & Age Requirement

- Shizuku is strictly intended for use within adult communities that have a stringent 18+ age requirement. We require server owners maintain and enforce a strict global 18+ age requirement to utilize Shizuku within their communities.
- Communities utilizing Shizuku must adhere to Discord's ToS, which includes ensuring all NSFW channels are appropriately age-gated. The majority of Shizuku's commands will not function in channels that are not properly marked as age-restricted.

---

## 3. Prohibited Communities

- Inviting Shizuku to any kink or NSFW-themed communities that permit minors under the age of 18 is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, "tbdl" themed servers.
- If we identify or receive reports of Shizuku being used in such an environment, we will promptly blacklist that server and its owner from accessing Shizuku. Additionally, we will report the server to Discord's Trust and Safety team where applicable.

---

## 4. Community Behavior and Safety

- Should we become aware of any community using Shizuku that is actively participating in harassment, doxxing, or any other harmful behavior that jeopardizes the health and safety of others, we reserve the right to terminate that community's access to Shizuku. This termination can occur with or without prior warning, solely at our discretion.

---

## 5. Banned Members

- Servers owned by members who have been permanently banned from the OmoOrg community, for any reason, are prohibited from inviting Shizuku.
- If servers are co-owned or attempt to bypass this policy by transferring ownership, they will similarly be denied access to Shizuku.

---

## 6. Disclaimers

- We provide Shizuku on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, or availability of Shizuku.
- In no event will we be liable for any damages, including, without limitation, direct or indirect damages, or any damages whatsoever arising from the use of Shizuku.

---

## 7. Changes to the Terms of Service

- We may modify or replace these ToS at any time. Continued use of Shizuku after any such changes signifies your acceptance of the new terms.

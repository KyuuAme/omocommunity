## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Shizuku Discord Bot processes user data on Discord servers. It outlines our practices concerning the data we collect from the users of Shizuku and the purposes for which we use this data.

---

## 2. Data We Collect

We only process data necessary for the core functionalities of the Shizuku Discord Bot. Shizuku may process server message events for the following functionalities:

- **Support tickets**: Messages sent within support tickets are retrieved and archived in a dedicated staff channel when they are closed.
- **Media-only channels**: Messages sent in media-only channels (a functionality that must be enabled by a server administrator) are processed to see if they contain a valid media object (i.e. an image or video).
- **Delete/edit logging**: If this functionality is enabled, details of messages that are deleted or edited are sent to a specified abuse logs channel.
- **Starboards**: Details of messages and their associated reactions that meet the criteria for the starboard feature are processed by Shizuku. Shizuku will copy the contents of these messages to a dedicated starboard channel. A copy of the original message ID, as well as the message ID of the starboard entry are stored internally.
- **User and Message IDs**: For certain features and functionalities, Shizuku may store user IDs and message IDs in her internal database. No personal information or message content is stored in relation to these IDs.
- **Usage Data**: Shizuku will store data on how users interact with her and participate in certain functionalities, such as the action and holding commands. This data is attributed solely to user Discord IDs, without storing any additional personal information, such as your username, display name, or other personal information.

Shizuku does not internally store message content after it has been processed. All sensitive data is processed in-memory and not stored anywhere within Shizuku's internal database. Shizuku only internally stores references to user ID's and message ID's.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

- **Support tickets**: Messages from closed tickets are archived and sent to a dedicated private staff channel for reference and collaboration.
- **Media-only channels**: Text-only messages are deleted, and users are DM'd with instructions for proper channel usage.
- **Delete/edit logging**: To track and log message edits or deletions in a dedicated staff channel to ensure server integrity and safety.
- **Starboards**: Messages that meet a set reaction threshold are featured in a dedicated starboard channel.
- **Sharing Ban Data**: If you are banned for certain egregious policy violations, Shizuku may share your user ID and moderator-provided ban explanations with other participating Discord servers for community safety purposes.

## 4. Storage and Security

- All logs processed by Shizuku are stored exclusively on Discord, within specified channels.
- User IDs, Message IDs, and interaction data are stored in Shizuku's internal database. No personal account details are stored beyond Discord IDs.
- We do not retain or store any message content data outside of Discord.
- Shizuku may access these messages again via the Discord API for basic functionality, provided the messages have not been deleted.

## 5. Your Rights

- You have the right to request that we erase specific data we hold about you. Usage data, like interaction records, can be removed upon request. However, data vital for the security of our communities, such as records of warnings and bans, cannot be deleted upon request.
